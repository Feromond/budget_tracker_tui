## 🚀 Getting Started

### Windows Installer (Recommended for Windows Users)

If you are on **Windows**, you can download and run the latest installer for a quick and easy setup. This is the simplest way to get started on Windows—no Rust or Cargo required!
(NOTE: I do not have a windows developer licence so it will be an unknown publisher)

- [Download the latest Windows installer from the Releases page](https://github.com/Feromond/budget_tracker_tui/releases)

### Prerequisites (for manual/cargo install)

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (includes `cargo`)
- No separate SQLite installation is required for normal builds; the app bundles SQLite through `rusqlite`.

### Installation & Running
> Still working on adding support for direct downloads via some linux package managers

**Build and Run Manually:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Feromond/budget_tracker_tui
cd budget_tracker_tui

# Build the project (use --release for optimized build)
cargo build --release

# Run the executable
./target/release/Budget_Tracker
```

**Install Globally with Cargo (Recommended for Linux/macOS):**

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd budget_tracker_tui

# Install the binary to Cargo's bin directory
cargo install --path .
```

After installation, the `Budget_Tracker` command should be available in your terminal directly.

_Optional Tip:_ For even quicker access, set up a shell alias:

```bash
# Example for bash/zsh (add to your .bashrc or .zshrc)
alias bt='Budget_Tracker'
```

Then, you can just type `bt` to launch the app.

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Launch the app:** `Budget_Tracker` (or `bt` if you set up the alias)
2. **Add a transaction:** Press `a`, fill in the fields, and press `Enter` to save.
3. **Navigate:** Use `↑`/`↓` to move between transactions, `PageUp`/`PageDown` to jump by pages, `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` to jump to first/last transaction.
4. **Sort transactions:** Press `1-6` to sort by Date, Description, Category, Subcategory, Type, or Amount respectively.
5. **Manage transactions:** Press `e` to edit, `d` to delete, `f` to filter, `r` to manage recurring transactions.
6. **View summaries:** Press `s` for monthly summary, `c` for category summary, and `b` for the budget view.
7. **Change settings:** Press `o` to open settings (change the transactions CSV path, SQLite database path, target budget, and manage categories).
8. **Quit:** Press `q` or `Esc`.
9. **Help:** Press `Ctrl+H` at any time to view the keybindings menu for the current mode.

## ⚙️ Settings & Configuration

- **Data File Path:**
  - The path to your `transactions.csv` file is configurable in-app (press `o` for settings).
  - Default locations: - **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/BudgetTracker/transactions.csv` (usually `~/.local/share/BudgetTracker/transactions.csv`) - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/BudgetTracker/transactions.csv` - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\BudgetTracker\transactions.csv` (e.g.,
    `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\BudgetTracker\transactions.csv`)
  - **Cross-Device Sync:** You can set your data file path to a cloud-synced folder (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.) to automatically sync your budget data across multiple devices. Just point the data file path to a location within your cloud storage folder!
- **Database Path:**
  - The category catalog is stored in a SQLite database file, configurable in-app from Settings.
  - By default, the database file is named `budget.db` and is placed alongside your current transactions CSV file.
  - On first run with a new database, the app seeds it with the default category catalog.
- **Manage Categories:**
  - From Settings, use **Manage Categories** to open the category catalog and add, edit, or delete categories/subcategories.
  - Expense categories can optionally store a per-category target budget for use in the budget view.
- **Target Budget:**
  - Set a monthly target budget in settings. This is used in the monthly summary and budget view.
- **Hourly Rate:**
  - (Optional) Set your hourly earning rate to toggle a view that shows transaction costs in "hours worked".
- **Fuzzy Search:**
  - Enable or disable the fuzzy search input for category selection (toggle in Settings menu `o`).
- **Config File:**
  - The application's settings are saved in a `config.json` file, which is stored in your OS's **config directory**:
    - **Linux:** `~/.config/BudgetTracker/config.json`
    - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/BudgetTracker/config.json`
    - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\BudgetTracker\config.json`
  - This is separate from the data file location, which is in your OS's data directory (see above).

## 📁 Data & CSV Format

- **CSV Columns:** `date, description, amount, transaction_type, category, subcategory`
- **Date Format:** Flexible! Accepts `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, or `DD-MM-YYYY`.
- **Transaction Type:** `Income` or `Expense` (case-insensitive, also accepts `i`/`e`)
- **Category/Subcategory:** Transaction rows should reference categories that exist in the SQLite category catalog. You can manage that catalog in-app from Settings.
- **Import/Export:** You can edit the transaction CSV in Excel/LibreOffice or import from other tools (just match the columns and use valid categories). SQLite support currently backs category data; transaction storage remains CSV for now.
- **Data Safety:** The app will not overwrite your transaction CSV unless you save a transaction, close the program, or change settings. Category edits are written to the SQLite database.
